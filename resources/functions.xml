In this file you can declare output wrapper functions.

text is the raw data variable that contains the output so you have
to modify it in order to change the output, you don't have to put a
return statement because text will be returned by default.

args instead are the arguments passed when the page was viewed.
eg: #page=faggotree&level=5 args will be {page : faggotree, level : 5}

Remember that it's javascript so you can write anything, but don't exagerate,
try to keep the function simple.

Wrappers are useful if you are going to use a module like syntax highlighting.

<functions>
    <function name="raw"><![CDATA[
        text = text.replace(/&/g,  '&amp;');
        text = text.replace(/</g,  '&lt;');
        text = text.replace(/>/g,  '&gt;');

        text = "<pre>" + text + "</pre>";
    ]]></function>
</functions>
